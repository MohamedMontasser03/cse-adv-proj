# JavaFX Simulink File Reader

--
This Java project is a file reader that allows you to read and analyze Simulink files with the .mdl extension. It utilizes JavaFX for the graphical user interface (GUI) to provide a user-friendly experience for browsing and exploring the contents of Simulink models.
--

# Features

Read and parse Simulink files (.mdl) to extract information about the model structure, blocks, and connections.
Display the parsed information in a hierarchical tree view for easy navigation.
Provide details about each block, including its parameters and connections.
Highlight connections between blocks for better visualization.
Allow searching for specific blocks within the model.
Export the extracted information as a report or in a structured format for further analysis.

# Prerequisites

To run this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
JavaFX SDK (included in JDK 11 and later versions)

# Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/javafx-simulink-file-reader.git
Open the project in your favorite code editor.

Configure the project to use JavaFX SDK as a dependency.
Extract the JavaFX SDK archive and copy the lib folder to the project's root directory.

and run the build bash script to compile the project and run the application providing the file path as an argument:

build.sh <file-path>

# Usage

Launch the application, and the GUI will appear on your screen.

The application will parse the file and display the model's structure.

Analyze the block connections and navigate through the model hierarchy.

Explore the Simulink model and leverage the application's features to gain insights and understand its structure.

# Acknowledgments

This project utilizes the power of JavaFX to create an interactive GUI for reading and analyzing Simulink files.
We are grateful to the Simulink community for their invaluable contributions and inspiration.
